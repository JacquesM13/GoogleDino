Using pyautogui to automate the Google 'No Internet' game.
Made use of grayscale, confidence values, and defined regions in order to reduce the time it takes the locateOnScreen() function to work.
Currently able to jump over all form of cactus up to a score ~250 (distance from object for jump must increase at this point). Can detect and avoid pterodactyl. Screen capture delay limits performance.
